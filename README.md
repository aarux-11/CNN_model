Using a Kaggle dataset this model classifies images of dogs and cats using deep learning.
The training dataset contains 25,000 images and the test set has 12,500 images. The complexity of a CNN is reduced using shared weights and nodes. 32 filters of size 3x3 are used to process the images. The input images are colored which is a code of 3 and 1 for binary images. Relu activation method, max(z,0) is used. An accuracy of 80% is achieved post testing.

1. Import the dataset post downloading it into the local system.
2. Unzip the contents in the Jupyter Notebook. Make different folders in the main directory and give the same path in code.
3. Run the file and the model creation is complete for deployment.
